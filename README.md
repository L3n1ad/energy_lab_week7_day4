# energy_mix_lab

The app is an energy tracker which displayes a bar chart where with energy percentage on the current day, it also can get that data depending on user input. If the user chooses a time period the app will get the data from the time period and displays the energy percentage of each sectior within the time period on the line chart. The app has minimul styling and depending how big the time period is fetching data can be slow. All the data is fetched from an external api: https://carbon-intensity.github.io/
